# Inhibition

Inhibition is similar to [Alertmanager's](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#inhibition-related-settings) mechanism, which allows suppressing less important incidents based on rules.

[Inhibit rules](../config_file.md#inhibit_rules) allow establishing parent-child relationships between incidents. If two incidents match one of the inhibit rules and the source incident is in the 'firing' status, the relationships will be established, and the child will be **frozen** until all its parent incidents are in the resolved status.

Incidents have `parents` and `childs` fields which contain lists of corresponding incident `uniq_id` values. This fields can be used in [templates](../config_file.md#messengertemplate_files). See `templates/slack_body.j2` for example.
