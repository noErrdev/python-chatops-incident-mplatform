# Versioning and Upgrade

## Versioning

IMPulse uses version numbers like **`v1.0.2`** where:

- **`1`** is a major version. It increases only when the user **must** perform manual operations to update
- **`0`** is a minor version. It increases when new features or many changes are added
- **`2`** is a bugfix version. It increases when code changes are minimal

## Upgrade

For the major version upgrade (**`v1.6.0` -> `v2.0.0`**) you should follow `Upgrade instructions` in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/DiTsi/impulse/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md). Major version upgrades must be performed sequentially: to upgrade from **`v1.0.0`** to **`v3.0.0`**, you must first upgrade to **`v2.0.0`**.

Other upgrades can be done without manual operations.

### Docker

1. See `impulse.yml` upgrade instructions in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/DiTsi/impulse/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) (**for major version upgrade**).
2. Set the new tag in `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Execute `docker compose up -d`.
